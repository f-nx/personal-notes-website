### What is Space Complexity?
Space complexity is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm
needs. That means how much memory, in the worst case, is needed at any point in
the algorithm.

### What causes Space Complexity? 

- **Variables**
- **Data Structures**
- **Function calls**
- **Allocations**

### Space-Time Tradeoff and Efficiency.

If you want your code to run faster then you might have to sacrifice more memory.
If you want your code to use less memory, the you might have to sacrifice with
increased runtime.
For example, Mergesort algorithm is exceedingly fast but requires a lot of space to
do the operations. On the other side, Bubble Sort is exceedingly slow but requires
the minimum space.
